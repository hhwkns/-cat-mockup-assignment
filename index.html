            <h4>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h4>
            <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine, snuggles up to shoulders or
                knees and purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintily with a claw
                then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation
                milk then <a href="#">retire to the warmest spot on the couch</a>
                to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to leap between
                furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor;
                what’s your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself
                intently cough and swat at dog.</p>
              <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sympathy) fooled again
                thinking the dog likes me. Jump launch to pounce upon little
                yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until
                treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always hungry for
                lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.</p>
